# MessageEncryptDecyptTool

This is my first year project using only c language. This project can encrypt plain text and decrypt cipher texts using two previously known keys. There are some properties for the given input to be a valid key. If you've entered a wrong key, then it will show you "Invalid input" message and will ask whether you want to continue or not. This can generate different cipher texts for same message.
